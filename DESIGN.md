## Design Principles

### Demo-First Design

This is a customer-facing demo, not a production application. Every design decision optimizes for:

- Visual impact in a 20-minute meeting
- Single-command deployability to any Snowflake account
- Minimal prerequisites (no external services, API keys, or complex config)
- A clear "wow moment" when AI_EXTRACT processes invoices live on stage

### Snowflake-Native Architecture

The demo showcases Snowflake capabilities, not generic Python data processing:

- All data lives in Snowflake tables
- PDF extraction uses `AI_EXTRACT` — no external OCR services
- Scheduling uses Snowflake Tasks + Streams — no Airflow or cron
- Visualization runs in Streamlit in Snowflake on Container Runtime
- Authentication uses Snowflake-native auth (zero app-level auth code)

### End-to-End Pipeline Story

The demo tells a complete story from raw PDF to actionable insight:

1. **Ingest** — PDF invoices land on a Snowflake stage
2. **Extract** — AI_EXTRACT pulls structured data (headers + line items)
3. **Automate** — A Task/Stream pipeline processes new files automatically
4. **Visualize** — Streamlit app shows AP ledger, aging, and spend analytics
5. **Live Demo** — Presenter stages new PDFs and watches extraction happen in real-time

### Realistic Synthetic Data

The demo data must be believable in a customer meeting:

- Real distributor names (McLane, Core-Mark, Coca-Cola, Frito-Lay)
- Real convenience store product names (not "Product A")
- Realistic invoice amounts, payment terms, and date ranges
- 100 invoices for initial load + 5 held back for live demo

### Development Standards

- **SQL excellence** — no `SELECT *`, CTEs over subqueries, comments explaining business logic, maintainable by an SE who isn't a SQL expert
- **Cost awareness** — `CPU_X64_XS` compute pool, X-Small warehouse, stream-gated task (no wasted compute), teardown script removes all objects
- **Simplicity** — if it adds complexity without demo value, skip it; if an SE would be confused by the code, simplify it

## Feature Specification

### User Story 1 — AP Ledger Overview (P1)

An SE opens the Streamlit app during a customer meeting with a convenience store chain's finance team. The landing page shows KPI cards: total payables outstanding, invoice count, overdue amount, and average days to pay. The AP Ledger page shows all extracted invoices with aging buckets and drill-down to line items.

**Why P1**: The AP ledger is the core deliverable — it proves that AI_EXTRACT turned unstructured PDFs into a structured, queryable accounts payable system.

**Acceptance criteria**:
1. KPI cards show aggregate AP metrics across all invoices on load
2. AP Ledger table filters by vendor and updates in place
3. Expanding an invoice row shows extracted line items (product, qty, price)

### User Story 2 — Spend Analytics (P1)

The SE navigates to the Analytics page showing spend by vendor (horizontal bar chart), monthly spend trend (line chart), category breakdown (treemap), and aging distribution (stacked bar). The customer sees how Snowflake turns raw invoices into actionable financial insights.

**Why P1**: Analytics is the "so what" — it shows the business value of automated invoice processing beyond just data extraction.

**Acceptance criteria**:
1. Spend by vendor chart shows top vendors ranked by total spend
2. All charts update when date range filter is applied
3. Category breakdown shows product categories (beverages, snacks, tobacco, etc.)

### User Story 3 — Live Extraction Demo (P1)

The SE demonstrates the "magic moment": from the Streamlit app, they stage new PDF invoices, trigger the extraction task, and watch the results appear in real-time. The progress panel shows files being detected and extracted.

**Why P1**: This is the wow moment — live AI processing in front of the customer proves the system works end-to-end, not just on pre-loaded data.

**Acceptance criteria**:
1. Clicking "Stage Demo Invoices" PUTs PDFs to the Snowflake stage and registers them in RAW_INVOICES
2. Clicking "Run Extraction" executes the task with a live progress panel
3. New invoices appear in the AP Ledger and Analytics pages after extraction

### User Story 4 — Automated Pipeline (P2)

A Snowflake Task monitors the stage via a Stream. Any new files added are automatically extracted without manual intervention. The task runs every 5 minutes and only activates when new data exists.

**Acceptance criteria**:
1. Stream detects new files and task processes them within 5 minutes
2. No compute is consumed when there are no new files (stream-gated)

### Edge Cases

- **Malformed PDF** — mark as `EXTRACTION_FAILED` with error message
- **Duplicate invoice** — deduplicate on filename
- **Concurrent task execution** — Snowflake handles task concurrency; only one instance runs

### User Story 5 — AI Extract Lab (P2)

The SE opens the AI Extract Lab page to interactively explore AI_EXTRACT capabilities. Three modes are available: Starter Template (pre-built prompts for invoice headers, line items, general Q&A), Visual Builder (point-and-click entity definition), and Raw JSON Editor. The SE can test extraction against any staged or uploaded PDF and see results immediately.

**Why P2**: The lab lets technically curious customers experiment with AI_EXTRACT prompts beyond the canned demo, extending the conversation into their own use cases.

**Acceptance criteria**:
1. Pre-built prompts available for invoice headers, line items, and general Q&A in Starter Template mode
2. Results display in a structured format when extraction runs against a staged PDF
3. Uploaded PDFs are staged and available for extraction

### User Story 6 — In-Snowflake Invoice Generation (P2)

The SE generates new PDF invoices directly inside Snowflake using a Python UDTF (`GENERATE_INVOICE_PDF`). This eliminates the need for local PDF generation and demonstrates Snowflake as a complete platform — even document creation runs inside the warehouse.

**Why P2**: Generating PDFs inside Snowflake is a strong "platform completeness" talking point and makes the live demo self-contained.

**Acceptance criteria**:
1. Selecting vendors and clicking generate creates new PDF invoices via the UDTF and stages them to @INVOICE_STAGE
2. AI_EXTRACT results on generated invoices match the generated content
