# AI_EXTRACT POC Kit

Extract structured data from your own PDFs, images, and documents using **Snowflake Cortex AI_EXTRACT** — entirely within your Snowflake account. No external services, no API keys, no data leaves Snowflake.

This kit walks you through a complete proof-of-concept:

1. **Stage** your documents in a Snowflake internal stage
2. **Extract** entity fields (header data) and tabular data (line items) using AI
3. **Visualize** results in an interactive Streamlit dashboard
4. **Automate** extraction of new documents via Stream + Task (optional)

**Total setup time: ~30 minutes** (excluding extraction runtime, which depends on document count).

## What You Need Before Starting

1. **5-20 sample documents** of the type you want to extract from (invoices, contracts, receipts, medical claims, etc.)
2. **A list of fields** you want to extract from each document. For example:
   - Invoices: vendor name, invoice number, date, due date, total amount, line items
   - Contracts: parties, effective date, expiration date, contract value, governing law
   - Receipts: store name, date, total, payment method, items purchased
3. **Access to Snowsight** (the Snowflake web UI) — all SQL scripts are designed to be run there

---

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Create Snowflake Objects

Open **`sql/01_setup.sql`** in a Snowsight worksheet.

**Edit the 4 variables at the top** to your preferred names (or keep the defaults):

```sql
SET poc_db        = 'AI_EXTRACT_POC';     -- database name
SET poc_schema    = 'DOCUMENTS';          -- schema name
SET poc_warehouse = 'AI_EXTRACT_WH';      -- warehouse name
SET poc_stage     = 'DOCUMENT_STAGE';     -- stage name
```

**Edit the role grant** on line 59 — replace `SYSADMIN` with the role you'll use:

```sql
GRANT DATABASE ROLE SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX_USER TO ROLE SYSADMIN;  -- <-- your role here
```

Run the entire script. This creates:
- A database and schema
- An X-SMALL warehouse (optimal for AI_EXTRACT — larger sizes don't improve performance)
- An internal stage with **SNOWFLAKE_SSE encryption** (required for AI_EXTRACT)

> **IMPORTANT:** The stage MUST use `ENCRYPTION = (TYPE = 'SNOWFLAKE_SSE')`. The default encryption (client-side) will **not** work with AI_EXTRACT, and you **cannot** change encryption after stage creation. Script 01 handles this correctly.

### Step 2: Upload Your Documents

Upload your sample documents to the `DOCUMENT_STAGE`. Choose one method:

**Option A — Snowsight UI (easiest):**
1. Navigate to **Data > Databases > AI_EXTRACT_POC > DOCUMENTS > Stages**
2. Click on **DOCUMENT_STAGE**
3. Click the **"+ Files"** button
4. Drag and drop your files

**Option B — Snowflake CLI:**
```bash
snow stage copy /path/to/your/documents/*.pdf @AI_EXTRACT_POC.DOCUMENTS.DOCUMENT_STAGE --overwrite
```

**Option C — SnowSQL:**
```sql
PUT file:///path/to/your/documents/*.pdf @AI_EXTRACT_POC.DOCUMENTS.DOCUMENT_STAGE AUTO_COMPRESS=FALSE;
```

After uploading, refresh the stage directory and verify:
```sql
ALTER STAGE DOCUMENT_STAGE REFRESH;
SELECT * FROM DIRECTORY(@DOCUMENT_STAGE) ORDER BY LAST_MODIFIED DESC;
```

You should see your files listed with their sizes and timestamps.

### Step 3: Create Tables

Open **`sql/02_tables.sql`** in Snowsight and run it.

This creates three tables:

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `RAW_DOCUMENTS` | Tracks every file staged for processing (file name, path, extraction status) |
| `EXTRACTED_FIELDS` | Stores entity-level data from each document (10 generic fields: `field_1` through `field_10`) |
| `EXTRACTED_TABLE_DATA` | Stores tabular/line-item data from each document (5 generic columns: `col_1` through `col_5`) |

The script also registers all staged files into `RAW_DOCUMENTS` automatically.

> **TIP:** You can rename the generic columns (`field_1`, `col_1`, etc.) to meaningful names for your document type. See [Customizing for Your Document Type](#customizing-for-your-document-type).

### Step 4: Test on ONE File First

This is the most important step. **Do not skip it.**

Open **`sql/03_test_single_file.sql`** in Snowsight.

1. Run the first query to list your staged files
2. Set `$test_file` to one of your file names:
   ```sql
   SET test_file = 'invoice_001.pdf';  -- <-- your actual filename
   ```
3. Run the **entity extraction** query (Step 2 in the script). This sends your document to AI_EXTRACT with 10 questions about header-level fields.

**Review the raw JSON output carefully:**

```json
{
  "response": {
    "vendor_name": "Acme Corp",
    "document_number": "INV-2024-001",
    "document_date": "2024-03-15",
    "total": "1234.56"
  }
}
```

**Check:**
- Are the field values correct (match what's on the document)?
- Are dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format?
- Are numbers clean (no `$`, commas, or currency symbols)?
- Did any fields return `null` that shouldn't be empty?

4. Run the **table extraction** query (Step 3 in the script). This extracts line items / tabular data.

5. If the output looks wrong, **adjust your prompts** and re-run. Common fixes:
   - Too vague? Be more specific: `'date'` → `'What is the invoice date? Return in YYYY-MM-DD format.'`
   - Numbers have `$`? Add: `'Return as a number only.'`
   - Wrong table found? Add a `description` field to help locate the right table

**Only proceed to batch extraction once you're satisfied with the single-file results.**

### Step 5: Batch Extract All Documents

Open **`sql/04_batch_extract.sql`** in Snowsight.

> **IMPORTANT:** If you modified the prompts in Step 4, copy those same prompts into this script. The prompts in `04_batch_extract.sql` must match what you validated in `03_test_single_file.sql`.

Run the entire script. This:

1. **Entity extraction** — Runs AI_EXTRACT on every unprocessed file, inserting results into `EXTRACTED_FIELDS`
2. **Table extraction** — Runs AI_EXTRACT again for tabular data, inserting into `EXTRACTED_TABLE_DATA`
3. **Marks files as extracted** — Updates `RAW_DOCUMENTS` so files aren't reprocessed

**Runtime:** Depends on document count and page count. A batch of 100 single-page invoices typically completes in 5-10 minutes on an X-SMALL warehouse.

After completion, verify:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS documents_extracted FROM EXTRACTED_FIELDS;
SELECT COUNT(*) AS line_items_extracted FROM EXTRACTED_TABLE_DATA;
SELECT * FROM EXTRACTED_FIELDS ORDER BY extracted_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### Step 6: Create Analytical Views

Open **`sql/05_views.sql`** in Snowsight and run it.

This creates 6 views that power the dashboard and enable ad-hoc analysis:

| View | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `V_EXTRACTION_STATUS` | Pipeline monitoring — total, extracted, pending, failed counts |
| `V_DOCUMENT_LEDGER` | Enriched document view with aging buckets (days past due) |
| `V_SUMMARY_BY_VENDOR` | Aggregates grouped by sender/vendor |
| `V_MONTHLY_TREND` | Volume and value over time |
| `V_TOP_LINE_ITEMS` | Most common / highest-spend items from table extraction |
| `V_AGING_SUMMARY` | Aggregate counts and amounts by aging bucket |

You can query these views directly:
```sql
-- How much do we owe each vendor?
SELECT * FROM V_SUMMARY_BY_VENDOR;

-- What's overdue?
SELECT * FROM V_DOCUMENT_LEDGER WHERE aging_bucket != 'Current' ORDER BY days_past_due DESC;

-- Monthly trend
SELECT * FROM V_MONTHLY_TREND;
```

---

## Customizing for Your Document Type

The default prompts extract **invoice** fields, but the kit works with any document type. Here's how to adapt it:

### 1. Edit Prompts (`sql/03_test_single_file.sql`)

The script includes commented-out examples for contracts and receipts. Replace the invoice prompts with questions relevant to your documents:

**Contract example:**
```sql
SELECT AI_EXTRACT(
    TO_FILE('@DOCUMENT_STAGE', $test_file),
    {
        'party_a':        'Who is the first party or client in this contract?',
        'party_b':        'Who is the second party or service provider?',
        'effective_date': 'What is the effective date? Return in YYYY-MM-DD format.',
        'expiration':     'What is the expiration or end date? Return in YYYY-MM-DD format.',
        'contract_value': 'What is the total contract value? Return as a number only.',
        'governing_law':  'What state or jurisdiction governs this contract?',
        'auto_renew':     'Does this contract auto-renew? Return YES or NO.'
    }
) AS extraction;
```

**Receipt example:**
```sql
SELECT AI_EXTRACT(
    TO_FILE('@DOCUMENT_STAGE', $test_file),
    {
        'store_name':      'What is the store or merchant name?',
        'receipt_number':  'What is the receipt or transaction number?',
        'date':            'What is the transaction date? Return in YYYY-MM-DD format.',
        'total':           'What is the total amount paid? Return as a number only.',
        'payment_method':  'What payment method was used (cash, credit card, etc.)?'
    }
) AS extraction;
```

### 2. Rename Table Columns (`sql/02_tables.sql`)

Map the generic columns to meaningful names:

```
field_1  → vendor_name (or party_a, store_name)
field_2  → invoice_number (or contract_id, receipt_number)
field_3  → po_number (or reference_number)
field_4  → document_date (DATE type)
field_5  → due_date (DATE type)
field_6  → payment_terms (or contract_type)
field_7  → bill_to (or recipient)
field_8  → subtotal (NUMBER 12,2)
field_9  → tax_amount (NUMBER 12,2)
field_10 → total_amount (NUMBER 12,2)
```

### 3. Update Batch Extraction (`sql/04_batch_extract.sql`)

Copy your validated prompts from Step 4 into the `AI_EXTRACT` calls in this script. The prompt keys must match exactly.

### 4. Update View Aliases (`sql/05_views.sql`)

The views reference `field_1` as `vendor_name`, `field_10` as `total_amount`, etc. Update the aliases to match your renamed columns.

### Prompt Engineering Tips

| Tip | Bad | Good |
|---|---|---|
| Be specific about which field | `'date'` | `'What is the invoice date? Return in YYYY-MM-DD format.'` |
| Request clean numbers | `'total'` | `'What is the total amount? Return as a number only.'` |
| Disambiguate tables | `'items'` | `'The table of line items showing product, quantity, and price'` |
| Handle missing fields | (no guidance) | `'What is the PO number? Return NULL if not present.'` |
| Format dates consistently | `'due date'` | `'What is the due date? Return in YYYY-MM-DD format. Return NULL if not present.'` |

## Understanding the Extraction Output

### Entity Extraction Response

AI_EXTRACT returns a JSON object with a `response` key:

```json
{
  "response": {
    "vendor_name": "Acme Corp",
    "document_number": "INV-2024-001",
    "document_date": "2024-03-15",
    "due_date": "2024-04-14",
    "total": "1234.56"
  }
}
```

Access individual fields with Snowflake's semi-structured syntax:
```sql
extraction:response:vendor_name::VARCHAR
TRY_TO_DATE(extraction:response:document_date::VARCHAR)
TRY_TO_NUMBER(REGEXP_REPLACE(extraction:response:total::VARCHAR, '[^0-9.]', ''), 12, 2)
```

The `TRY_TO_NUMBER` with `REGEXP_REPLACE` pattern strips any stray `$`, `,`, or whitespace before casting — this prevents failures on slightly messy outputs.

### Table Extraction Response

Table extraction returns parallel arrays:

```json
{
  "response": {
    "line_items": {
      "Line": [1, 2, 3],
      "Description": ["Widget A", "Widget B", "Shipping"],
      "Qty": [10, 5, 1],
      "Unit Price": [9.99, 14.99, 0],
      "Total": [99.90, 74.95, 12.50]
    }
  }
}
```

The `LATERAL FLATTEN` pattern in `04_batch_extract.sql` unnests these arrays into rows. The `WHERE ln.index = pr.index AND ...` clause ensures columns stay aligned:

```sql
FROM extracted e,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(INPUT => e.extraction:response:line_items:Line)        ln,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(INPUT => e.extraction:response:line_items:Description) pr,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(INPUT => e.extraction:response:line_items:Qty)         qt
WHERE ln.index = pr.index
  AND ln.index = qt.index;
```

> **Never remove the index alignment conditions.** Without them, you get a cross join of all array elements.

## Deploying the Dashboard

The `streamlit/` folder contains a 3-page Streamlit in Snowflake app. Deployment is optional but gives you an interactive way to explore results.

### Prerequisites for Dashboard

- A **compute pool** (created by `07_deploy_streamlit.sql`)
- An **External Access Integration** for PyPI (so Container Runtime can install `plotly` and `pypdfium2`)
- ACCOUNTADMIN role for creating the EAI

### Deploy Steps

1. **Upload Streamlit files** to the Streamlit stage. In Snowsight or via CLI:

   ```bash
   # Snowflake CLI
   snow stage copy streamlit/streamlit_app.py @STREAMLIT_STAGE/ --overwrite
   snow stage copy streamlit/config.py       @STREAMLIT_STAGE/ --overwrite
   snow stage copy streamlit/environment.yml @STREAMLIT_STAGE/ --overwrite
   snow stage copy streamlit/pages/          @STREAMLIT_STAGE/pages/ --overwrite
   ```

2. **Run `sql/07_deploy_streamlit.sql`** in Snowsight. This creates the compute pool, EAI, and Streamlit app.

3. **Edit role references** in `07_deploy_streamlit.sql`:
   - Line 63: `USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;` — needed for creating the EAI
   - Line 76: `USE ROLE SYSADMIN;` — change to your working role

4. **Open the app**: Navigate to **Snowsight > Projects > Streamlit > AI_EXTRACT_DASHBOARD**

### Dashboard Pages

| Page | What It Shows |
|---|---|
| **Landing** | Pipeline status (total/extracted/pending/failed), architecture diagram, extraction summary |
| **Dashboard** | KPI cards (total documents, total amount, unique senders, overdue), recent documents table |
| **Document Viewer** | Filter by sender/status, browse documents, drill down to see extracted fields alongside the rendered source PDF |
| **Analytics** | Bar chart by sender, monthly trend area chart, aging distribution, top 20 line items |

---

## Setting Up Automation

After validating that batch extraction works, you can automate processing of newly staged documents.

Open **`sql/06_automate.sql`** in Snowsight and run it. This creates:

| Object | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `RAW_DOCUMENTS_STREAM` | Append-only stream that detects new rows in `RAW_DOCUMENTS` |
| `SP_EXTRACT_NEW_DOCUMENTS` | Stored procedure that runs entity + table extraction on unprocessed files |
| `EXTRACT_NEW_DOCUMENTS_TASK` | Scheduled task that runs every 5 minutes when the stream has data |

**How automation works:**
1. You upload a new document to `DOCUMENT_STAGE`
2. You register it in `RAW_DOCUMENTS` (or the INSERT from `02_tables.sql` does this)
3. The stream detects the new row
4. The task fires within 5 minutes and calls the stored procedure
5. The procedure extracts fields and line items, then marks the file as processed

**To test manually** (without waiting 5 minutes):
```sql
EXECUTE TASK EXTRACT_NEW_DOCUMENTS_TASK;
```

**To pause automation:**
```sql
ALTER TASK EXTRACT_NEW_DOCUMENTS_TASK SUSPEND;
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `AI_EXTRACT function not found` | SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX_USER role not granted | `GRANT DATABASE ROLE SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX_USER TO ROLE <your_role>;` (requires ACCOUNTADMIN) |
| `File not found` or `stage not found` | Stage path is wrong, or directory table is stale | Run `ALTER STAGE DOCUMENT_STAGE REFRESH;` then `SELECT * FROM DIRECTORY(@DOCUMENT_STAGE)` to verify |
| `Unsupported encryption type` | Stage uses client-side encryption (the default) | You must create the stage with `ENCRYPTION = (TYPE = 'SNOWFLAKE_SSE')`. This **cannot** be changed after creation — drop and recreate the stage. |
| Empty extraction results | Prompts too vague, or document is scanned/low-quality | Make prompts more specific. Try a cleaner file. Check raw JSON in `03_test_single_file.sql`. |
| `Region not supported` | Account is in a non-supported region | `ALTER ACCOUNT SET CORTEX_ENABLED_CROSS_REGION = 'ANY_REGION';` (requires ACCOUNTADMIN) |
| Numbers extracted as strings (`$1,234.56`) | Prompt doesn't request numeric format | Add `'Return as a number only.'` to numeric prompts |
| `FLATTEN returns no rows` | Table extraction returned empty arrays | Check raw JSON in `03_test_single_file.sql` — the model may not have found a table. Add a more specific `description` to help locate it. |
| `Compute pool not ready` | Pool is still provisioning | Wait 1-2 minutes. Run `DESCRIBE COMPUTE POOL AI_EXTRACT_POC_POOL;` to check status. |
| Streamlit app shows errors | Views or tables don't exist yet | Run scripts 01-05 before deploying the Streamlit app |
| `PYPI_ACCESS_INTEGRATION` error | EAI not created or not granted | Run the EAI creation in `07_deploy_streamlit.sql` as ACCOUNTADMIN |
| Duplicate rows in `EXTRACTED_FIELDS` | Script was run twice on same files | The scripts include `NOT IN (SELECT file_name FROM ...)` guards, but if you re-run manually, check for duplicates: `SELECT file_name, COUNT(*) FROM EXTRACTED_FIELDS GROUP BY 1 HAVING COUNT(*) > 1` |

---

## Cost Estimate

AI_EXTRACT pricing is based on Cortex AI tokens:

| Component | Token Cost |
|---|---|
| Each page of a PDF/DOCX/TIFF | 970 tokens |
| Each image file (PNG, JPG, etc.) | 970 tokens (= 1 page) |
| Input prompt tokens | Variable (typically small) |
| Output tokens | Variable |

**Example: 100 single-page invoices with 10 entity questions + 1 table question**
- Input: 100 files x 970 tokens/page = 97,000 tokens
- Entity extraction: ~20 questions worth (10 entity + 1 table x10) per file
- Approximate total: ~200K-300K tokens per run (entity + table extraction)

**Warehouse cost:**
- AI_EXTRACT performance does **not** improve with larger warehouse sizes
- **X-SMALL is recommended** — you pay for less compute while getting the same extraction speed
- The warehouse is only active during extraction queries; auto-suspend handles idle time

---

## Cleanup

To remove all POC objects from your account:

```sql
-- Drop the database (removes everything: schema, tables, views, stage, stream, task, procedure)
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS AI_EXTRACT_POC;

-- Drop the warehouse
DROP WAREHOUSE IF EXISTS AI_EXTRACT_WH;

-- Drop the compute pool (if you deployed the dashboard)
DROP COMPUTE POOL IF EXISTS AI_EXTRACT_POC_POOL;

-- Optionally remove the EAI and network rule (if no other apps use them)
-- DROP EXTERNAL ACCESS INTEGRATION IF EXISTS PYPI_ACCESS_INTEGRATION;
-- DROP NETWORK RULE IF EXISTS PYPI_NETWORK_RULE;
```

---

## Next Steps

After a successful POC:

1. **Rename columns** — Replace `field_1`...`field_10` and `col_1`...`col_5` with meaningful names
2. **Add error handling** — Wrap extraction in TRY/CATCH to capture failures per document
3. **Scale up** — Stage thousands of documents and run batch extraction
4. **Automate** — Enable the Stream + Task pipeline from `06_automate.sql`
5. **Integrate** — Connect extraction output to your ERP, AP system, or data warehouse via Snowflake data sharing, Snowpipe, or direct table access
6. **Explore the reference demo** — A full-featured invoice processing app with generated test data, additional analytics, and E2E tests: [github.com/sfc-gh-jkang/ap-invoice-processing-demo](https://github.com/sfc-gh-jkang/ap-invoice-processing-demo)
